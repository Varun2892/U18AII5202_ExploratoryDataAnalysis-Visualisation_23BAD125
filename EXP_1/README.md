## Objective

To analyze internal assessment data of students and visualize subject performance, trends across tests, and final grade distribution using R.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`student_performance.csv`) contains academic details of students including:

* Student ID
* Subject
* Internal Test 1 Marks
* Internal Test 2 Marks
* Final Grade

The data is used to evaluate student performance across multiple subjects and assessments.

## Tools & Libraries Used

* R Programming
* ggplot2
* dplyr
* tidyr

---

## Visualizations Implemented

### 1. Subject-wise Average Marks (Bar Chart)

* Calculates average marks across internal tests for each subject.
* Helps identify difficult subjects and performance gaps.

### 2. Performance Trend Across Internal Tests (Line Chart)

* Compares marks of Internal Test 1 and Test 2 subject-wise.
* Useful for analyzing improvement or decline patterns.

### 3. Final Grade Distribution (Pie Chart)

* Shows proportion of students under each grade category.
* Provides overall academic performance insight.

## Workflow Summary

1. Load dataset
2. Remove missing values
3. Compute average internal marks
4. Aggregate subject-wise performance
5. Visualize trends and grade distribution

## Outcome

The experiment successfully highlights:

* Subject difficulty based on average marks
* Test-wise performance variations
* Grade distribution patterns for academic analysis
